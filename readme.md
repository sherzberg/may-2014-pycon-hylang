PyCon2014 Recap
---------------

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yo1qLVrTidHiKZDcA_GZRwHxZjM8dgftj7lOCO390gM/edit?usp=sharing) to my recap of PyCon 2014


Hylang/AST manipulation workshop
--------------------------------

Hylang setup on python 2.7:

```bash
$ pip install https://github.com/hylang/hy/archive/master.zip
$ hy -c '(import hy) (print hy.__version__)'
0.10.0
$ 
```

If you get _0.10.0_ printed, you have everything installed correctly.
We install _0.10.0_  because it has _hy2py_ which is not released yet.

Goals
-----

* Learn about PyCon2014 and why you should go
* Get an abbreviated overview of Hy
* Learn how to look at and possibly use Python AST
* Learn how Hy uses the Python AST
